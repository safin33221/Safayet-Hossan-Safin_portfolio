                                My coding journey began when I didn't have a device to practice on. I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by writing everything down in a notebook. After four months, thanks to my family's support, I got my first laptop. However, even with a device, I struggled to progress without proper guidance or a care team. At one point, I wanted to ask my family for money to pursue further learning, but our financial situation wasn't great. Determined, I began saving money for six months to invest in a course that could guide me. Finally, I was able to afford the Programming Hero Web Development course, which has been one of the best learning platforms in Bangladesh and has greatly helped me in my journey to becoming a web developer.
